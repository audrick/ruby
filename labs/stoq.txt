# Step 1

# create a user 
# what is their name?
# what is their password?
# how much cash do they have?
# create as many users as you want, e.g. 3?

# Step 2

# be able to log-in as that user
# login as that user?
	# ["Joe", "sally", or "jim"]

# user needs to log-in correctly, if password is incorrect, can't get inject

# once user gets in, they can buy stock

# Step 3

# user has stock

# user can purchase stock
	# enter the stock symbol
	# how many shares do you want to buy?
	# use last trade price as the purchase price

	# if not enough money, some kind of message

# do this as a loop

#Step 4

# show stoq dashboard
# show current stock price
# show the change from last quote (e.g. -0.13)
# show the average stock price
# show the number of shares you have
# show how much you have in the stock (shares * last stock price)

# stoq dashboard must run in a loop
# screen needs to refresh
